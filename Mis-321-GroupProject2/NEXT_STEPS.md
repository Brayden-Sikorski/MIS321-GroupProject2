# ✅ Almost Ready!

## Current Status:
- ✅ Backend API installed and ready
- ✅ Database system set up (sql.js - local SQLite file)
- ✅ Calculators working (carbon & breakeven)
- ⏳ Need to add authentication to app.js

## To Complete Setup:

### 1. Start the Server
Open a NEW terminal and run:
```bash
cd C:\cmder\MIS321-GroupProject2\Mis-321-GroupProject2\api
node server.js
```

### 2. What Works Now:
- ✅ All calculators work perfectly
- ⏳ Authentication needs to be added
- ❌ Profile page needs to be added

## Quick Option:
Right now your calculators work fine! You can use them without login. If you want to add the login/profile features, I need to add about 200 lines of authentication code to app.js.

Would you like me to:
1. Add full authentication now (login, register, profile pages)
2. Just test what we have first

Let me know!
